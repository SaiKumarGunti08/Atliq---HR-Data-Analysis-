### HR Analysis on Employee's Data ("Atliq")

## **Employees Data Analysis Project**

### Summary**
The Employees Data Analysis Project is a Power BI-based solution designed to provide actionable insights into employee performance, demographics, and organizational metrics. It empowers HR teams and managers to make data-driven decisions to enhance productivity and engagement.

---

### **Project Objectives**
- To analyze employee-related data and provide a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs).
- To identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement within the organization.
- To create dynamic and interactive visualizations that allow for in-depth data exploration.
- To enable stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time analytics.
